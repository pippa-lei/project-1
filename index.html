<h3>Canto I</h3>

<p>IN the midway of this our mortal life,<br>
I found me in a gloomy wood, astray<br>
Gone from the path direct: and e'en to tell<br>
It were no easy task, how savage wild<br>
That forest, how robust and rough its growth,<br>
Which to remember only, my dismay<br>
Renews, in bitterness not far from death.<br>
Yet to discourse of what there good befell,<br>
All else will I relate discover'd there.<br>
How first I enter'd it I scarce can say,<br>
Such sleepy dullness in that instant weigh'd<br>
My senses down, when the true path I left,<br>
But when a mountain's foot I reach'd, where clos'd<br>
The valley, that had pierc'd my heart with dread,<br>
I look'd aloft, and saw his shoulders broad<br>
Already vested with that planet's beam,<br>
Who leads all wanderers safe through every way.</p>
<br>
<p>Then was a little respite to the fear,<br>
That in my heart's recesses deep had lain,<br>
All of that night, so pitifully pass'd:<br>
And as a man, with difficult short breath,<br>
Forespent with toiling, 'scap'd from sea to shore,<br>
Turns to the perilous wide waste, and stands<br>
At gaze; e'en so my spirit, that yet fail'd<br>
Struggling with terror, turn'd to view the straits,<br>
That none hath pass'd and liv'd.  My weary frame<br>
After short pause recomforted, again<br>
I journey'd on over that lonely steep,</p>
